# IDS Portfolio of Building Blocks
This is the repository to provide an overview of available IDS Building Blocks that are available as open source projects, including the projects qualified via [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) and others that contain pieces to initiate a data space. 

These tables below list projects, classified by their component type and are curated by the [IDSA](https://internationaldataspaces.org/) Head Office.

[Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) | is an implementation of an IDS connector component following the IDS Reference Architecture Model. | [Here](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
[Eclipse Dataspace Connector](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector) | The Eclipse Dataspace Connector will implement the International Data Spaces standard (IDS) as well as relevant protocols and requirements associated with the Gaia-X and thereby provide implementation and feedback to these initatives. The connectorâ€™s added value is achieved through the separation of control and data plane, which enables a modular and thereby customizable way to build dataspaces. Due to common interfaces and mapping of existing standards, the connector adds capabilities of contract negotiating and policy handling in an interoperable manner.  | [Here](https://eclipse-dataspaceconnector.github.io/DataSpaceConnector/#/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
[TRUE (TRUsted Engineering) Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) | Connector for the IDS (International Data Space) ecosystem | [Here](https://fiware-true-connector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
