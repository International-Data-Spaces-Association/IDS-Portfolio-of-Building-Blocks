# IDS-Portfolio-of-Building-Blocks
This is the repository to provide an overview of available IDS Building Blocks that are available as open source projects, including the projects qualified via [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) and others that contain pieces to initiate a data space. 

These tables below list projects, classified by their component type and are curated by the [IDSA](https://internationaldataspaces.org/) Head Office.

[Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) | is an implementation of an IDS connector component following the IDS Reference Architecture Model. | [Here](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
[Eclipse Dataspace Connector](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector) | Existing open-source projects address the technical challenges of cataloguing and transferring data for a wide range of use cases. However, there is no open-source effort aimed at providing an interoperable, cross-organization framework for data sharing that is built on a common identity model and uniform policy enforcement. This project will integrate with existing data exchange technologies and provide these missing pieces to create a system for data sharing where each organization is able to exert control over how its shared data is used. | [Here](https://eclipse-dataspaceconnector.github.io/DataSpaceConnector/#/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
