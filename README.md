# IDS Portfolio of Building Blocks
This is the repository to provide an overview of available IDS Building Blocks that are available as open source projects, including the projects qualified via [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) and others that contain pieces to initiate a data space. 

:heavy_plus_sign: To add a project to the tables below, please [follow the steps mentioned here](Add-Your-Project.md).

These tables below list projects, classified by their component type and are curated by the [IDSA](https://internationaldataspaces.org/) Head Office.

:triangular_flag_on_post: [IDS Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) is offered to be used for component behaviour testing, interoperability testing against IDS components (Connector, DAPS, CA, Metadata Broker), preparation for IDS certification and also as a starting point for creation of data spaces. 

# Connector
Name | Description | Documentation | [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) level |
--- | --- | --- | --- | 
[Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) | is an implementation of an IDS connector component following the IDS Reference Architecture Model. | [Documentation](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Logo.png)
[Eclipse Dataspace Connector](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector) | The Eclipse Dataspace Connector will implement the International Data Spaces standard (IDS) as well as relevant protocols and requirements associated with the Gaia-X and thereby provide implementation and feedback to these initatives. The connectorâ€™s added value is achieved through the separation of control and data plane, which enables a modular and thereby customizable way to build dataspaces. Due to common interfaces and mapping of existing standards, the connector adds capabilities of contract negotiating and policy handling in an interoperable manner.  | [Documentation](https://eclipse-dataspaceconnector.github.io/DataSpaceConnector/#/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
[TRUE (TRUsted Engineering) Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) | Connector for the IDS (International Data Space) ecosystem | [Documentation](https://fiware-true-connector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | ![IDS Sandbox](images/IDSA-Sandbox-Small.png)
[Trusted Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/trusted-connector) | is an Apache Karaf-based platform for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). | [Documentation](https://industrial-data-space.github.io/trusted-connector-documentation/docs/dev_core/) | Not Available


# Metadata Broker
Name | Description | Documentation | [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) level |
--- | --- | --- | --- | 
[Metadata Broker Open Core](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/metadata-broker-open-core) | is an implementation of an International Data Spaces (IDS) Metadata Broker, which is a registry for IDS Connector self-description documents. It is currently under development and intends to act as a reference for members of the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) to help with the implementation of custom Broker solutions. | [Github Repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/metadata-broker-open-core) | Not Available


# Identity Management
Name | Description | Documentation | [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) level |

[ParIS Open Core](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ParIS-open-core) | is an implementation of an International Data Spaces (IDS) Participant Information Service (ParIS), which is a registry for IDS Participant self-description documents. It is currently under development and intends to act as a reference for members of the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) to help with the implementation of custom ParIS solutions. | [Github Repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ParIS-open-core) | Not Available


# App Store
Name | Description | Documentation | [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) level |
--- | --- | --- | --- | 
[IDS-AppStore](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-AppStore) | is an implementation of the App Store by Fraunhofer FIT. | [Github Repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-AppStore) | Not Available


# Clearing House
Name | Description | Documentation | [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) level |
--- | --- | --- | --- | 
[IDS Clearing House Core](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ids-clearing-house-core) | is an implementation of the IDS Clearing House. It consists of two microservices that support the Clearing House Service, which is a prototype implementation of the Clearing House component of the Industrial Data Space | [Github Repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ids-clearing-house-core) | Not Available
