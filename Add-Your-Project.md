## How to Add a Project to the IDS Portfolio of Building Blocks? 
To add your project into the tables listed on the [home page of IDS Portfolio of Building Blocks](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Portfolio-of-Building-Blocks), we recommend you to follow the steps below: 

1) Provide information on your project by creating an [issue here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Portfolio-of-Building-Blocks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=building-block-addition-request.md&title=)
2) IDSA Head Office staff will review your issue/application and come back to you if any questions arise.
3) After your project gets added into the list we highly recommend you to immediately apply to the [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) as a Sandbox project, by using [Sandbox application form on IDSA website](https://internationaldataspaces.org/sandbox-application/). 


We use [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) to assess the quality and maturity level of IDS projects, which is led by Technical Steering Committee of IDSA. Thus, we strongly advise all projects to apply to it. As you can see on the picture below, IDS Graduation Scheme consists of three stages (Sandbox, Incubated and Graduated), where the first stage (Sandbox) has a low entry barrier.

Following the acceptance of your Sandbox application, your project will start as a Sandbox project and will hopefully evolve through it with time. You can see the list of existing [projects that are part of IDS Graduation scheme here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/graduation_scheme/Projects.md).
