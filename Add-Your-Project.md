## How to Add a Project to the IDS Portfolio of Building Blocks? 
To add your project into the tables listed on the [home page of IDS Portfolio of Building Blocks](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Portfolio-of-Building-Blocks), we recommend you to follow these steps below:

1) Provide information on your project by creating an [issue here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Portfolio-of-Building-Blocks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=building-block-addition-request.md&title=)
2) We will review your issue/application and come back to you if any questions arise.
3) After your project gets added into the list we recommend you to apply to the [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) as a Sandbox project, by using [Sandbox application form on IDSA website](https://internationaldataspaces.org/sandbox-application/).
